## Networking Fundamentals

### OSI Model

- Describe the OSI model
- Explain how knowing the layer of a problem helps to find a root cause of a network/http problem?

### Layer 3 - Subnets

- Describe what IPv4 address is and what it is used for
- Describe what a subnet is and what is used for
- Explain the CIDR blocks and give example for min/max IP and the number of IPs 
- Describe public vs. private subnets in a hosting environment

### Layer 4 - TCP

- What is ports and what are they used for
- How many ports

### Web in OSI

- What OSI layers is needed for DNS/HTTPs to work
- What is DNS and what are A and CNAME records?

### Firewalls

- What is a Firewall and which layers can it operate on?
- How can access be restricted to specific server?
- How can access be restricted to a group of servers in same subnet?
- How can access be restricted to specific applications?

## Web Routing, Load Balancing and Reverse Proxying Fundamentals

### Basic HTTP/S

1. Can you sketch a raw http request and response?
2. What is HTTPS, SSL and TLS?
3. How sketch the steps how do DNS, TLS and HTTP work together when a user browses https://www.google.de?

### Reverse Proxies and Routing

1. What is reverse proxy?
2. What is Path and Host based routing?
3. What is SSL/TLS Offloading?
4. Whatâ€™s the difference between the Http-reverse-proxy and a network-loadbalancer?

### Load Balancing

1. Can you describe how DNS based HTTP load balancing works?
2. Can you describe how Reverse-Proxy based HTTP load balancing works?
3. Can you describe how TCP-IP based HTTP load balancing works?

### Failover

1. What is a failover and how does it compare to switchover?
2. Can you describe some load balancing algorithms?
3. What is difference between static and dynamic load balancing algorithm?
4. What is floating ip failover?
